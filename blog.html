            <h3>1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage</h3>
            <p>The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or local
                storage. It allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data items.</p>
            <p>The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.</p>
            <p>Local Storage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab,
                or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.</p>
            <p>Session Storage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
                browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new
                storage.
