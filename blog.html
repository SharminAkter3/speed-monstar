            <h3>1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage ?</h3>
            <p>The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or local
                storage. It allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data items.</p>
            <p>The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.</p>
            <p>Local Storage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab,
                or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.</p>
            <p>Session Storage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
                browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new
                storage.
            </p>

            <h3>2. What is the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope ?</h3>
            <p>In contrast to global variables, locally scoped ones are only visible within the function they are
                declared. Each function written in JavaScript creates a new local scope and every variable declared in
                this scope is a local variable. That means that variables with the same name can be used in different
                functions.</p>
            <p>So far, we've seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the
                global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local
                ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.</p>
            <p>
                The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if
                conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because
                the variables are still in the same scope.
            </p>
